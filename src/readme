Programming Assignment 3: Autocomplete


/******************************************************************************
 *  Describe how your firstIndexOf() method in BinarySearchDeluxe.java
 *  finds the first index of a key that equals the search key.
 *****************************************************************************/

if the comparator finds that it is equal to the key it will keep moving left or  -1
till it cannot move left and be equal. then takes the last equal number and returns it.

/******************************************************************************
 *  What is the order of growth of the number of compares (in the
 *  worst case) that each of the operations in the Autocomplete
 *  data type make, as a function of the number of terms n and the
 *  number of matching terms m?
 *
 *  Recall that with order-of-growth notation, you should discard
 *  leading coefficients and lower-order terms, e.g., m^2 + m log n.
 *****************************************************************************/

constructor:
assuming it is unsorted.
n log N + N
MergeSort
Takes N to copy the Array

allMatches():
log N + log N + N log N = log N + N log N
two binary searches and a merge sort.

numberOfMatches():
Log N + log N = log N
two binary searches.



/******************************************************************************
 *  Known bugs / limitations.
 *****************************************************************************/
no known bugs or limitations

/******************************************************************************
 *  Describe whatever help (if any) that you received.
 *  Don't include readings, lectures, and precepts, but do
 *  include any help from people (including course staff, lab TAs,
 *  classmates, and friends) and attribute them by name.
 *
 *  Also include any resources (including the web) that you may
 *  may have used in creating your design.
 *****************************************************************************/
Stack overflow for taking a slice of an array. algs 4 binary search class.

/******************************************************************************
 *  Describe any serious problems you encountered.
 *****************************************************************************/
resolving how to return a slice of an array without getting errors. which included sending back an empty array.

/******************************************************************************
 *  If you worked with a partner, assert below that you followed
 *  the protocol as described on the assignment page. Give one
 *  sentence explaining what each of you contributed.
 ******************************************************************************
 John - Helped with debugging cleaning up code and exception handling and the autocomplete class taking.


Nancy - built terms, and binary search deluxe classes and figured out how to find the first and last index
in the searches.
